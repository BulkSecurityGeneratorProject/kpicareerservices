# KPI Career Servises

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:
* Node.js
* Yarn
* gulp
* bower
* maven

## Building for production

To optimize the kpics application for production, run:

    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar target/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.
